usually, he would be [MASK] around the living room, playing with his toys.
but just one [MASK] at a minion sent him practically catatonic.
that had been megan's plan when she got him dressed [MASK].
he'd seen the movie almost by [MASK], considering he was a little young for the pg cartoon, but with older cousins, along with her brothers, mason was often exposed to things that were older.
she [MASK] to think being surrounded by adults and older kids was one reason why he was a such a good talker for his age.
aren't you being a [MASK] boy?
mason barely [MASK] her.
instead, his baby blues remained focused on the [MASK].
since the movie was almost over, megan knew she better slip into the bedroom and [MASK] getting ready.
each time she looked into mason's face, she was grateful that he [MASK] nothing like his father.
his platinum blond hair and blue eyes were [MASK] hers.
it was only his build that he was [MASK] after his father.
where megan was a diminutive 5'3'', davis was 6'1'' and two hundred [MASK].
mason was already [MASK] off the charts in height and weight according to his pediatrician.
davis had [MASK] mason only twice in his lifetime, the day he had been born and the day he came home from the hospital.
after that, he hadn't been interested in any of the pictures and emails megan [MASK].
with his professional football career on the rise, davis hadn't [MASK] to be shackled with the responsibilities of a baby.
instead, he wanted to [MASK] his time off the field partying until all hours of the night.
he only paid child [MASK] when megan threatened to have his wages garnished.
she dreaded the [MASK] when mason was old enough to ask about his father.
she never wanted [MASK] in the world to hurt him, and she knew that being rejected by his father would.
with a sigh, she stepped [MASK] the dress and slid it over her hips.
wrestling around to get the zipper [MASK] the way up caused her to huff and puff.
standing back from the [MASK], she turned to and fro to take in her appearance.
she'd always [MASK] how the dress made her feel sexy, but at the same time was very respectable.
while it boasted a sweetheart neckline, the hemline [MASK] just below her knees.
she put on her pearls-a high school graduation gift from her uncle aidan, or ankle, as she [MASK] called him.
aidan was her mother's baby brother and only son of the [MASK].
when she was born, he was only eight and a [MASK].
as the first grandchild, megan spent a lot of time with her [MASK], and that in turn, meant she spent a lot of time with aidan.
he had devoted hours to holding her and spoiling her [MASK].
when it came time for her to [MASK], she just couldn't seem to get uncle aidan out.
it was a nickname that had [MASK] with him even now that he was thirty-four and married.
while it had been no [MASK] that she wanted him as godfather for mason, she had been extremely honored when he and his wife, emma, had asked her to be their son, noah's, godmother.
she loved her newest cousin very much and planned to be the best godmother she could [MASK] him.
as she stepped out of the bedroom, she found that mason had yet to [MASK].
okay buddy, time to [MASK].
when he started to whine, she [MASK] her head.
we have such a fun day [MASK] of us.
it's noah's baptism, and then there's a party at uncle aidan and aunt emma's [MASK].
yes, you'll get to see and play with beau, [MASK].
as she went to the couch and picked him [MASK], she couldn't help finding it amusing that out of everyone he was going to see today, he was most excited about being with aidan and emma's black lab, beau.
one day when they had their own place [MASK], she would get him a dog.
he loved them too much to be [MASK].
oomph, she muttered, as they started up the basement [MASK].
yes, you're getting to be such a big, [MASK] boy.
when they [MASK] it to the kitchen, megan paused to catch her breath.
she only had a [MASK] before her mother breezed in with sean, and her youngest brother, gavin.
[MASK] like she was once again a teenager, she filed behind her parents as they headed into the garage.
i want to drive, gavin [MASK].
with a smirk, sean replied, like i'm gonna let you [MASK] my car.
he then slid into the driver's seat as gavin reluctantly walked around to the passenger's [MASK].
we'll see you there in just a few, her mother [MASK].
sean acknowledged her [MASK] a two finger salute before cranking up and pulling down the driveway.
megan worked to get mason into the car seat in her parents' land [MASK].
once he was safely [MASK] and buckled in, she hopped in beside him.
her parents rattled along to each other as they made their way through the tree-lined suburbs where megan had [MASK] up.
while some might look on her as having a mark against her [MASK] being an unwed mother, she had lived a relatively non-rebellious life.
even though she'd been a [MASK] and ran with the popular crowd in school, she rarely partied to excess.
instead, she had focused on [MASK] good grades.
at that time, she had her heart set on going to medical school and becoming a [MASK].
from the time she was a little girl, she had wanted nothing more than to help [MASK].
she was always mending birds with broken wings or trying to resuscitate [MASK] who had been hit by cars.
she ditched playing princess for playing [MASK].
her desire to become a [MASK] was why she needed the best scores and best activities and why she generally shunned any temptations to lead her off the right path.
she had even managed to [MASK] the usual freshman craziness when she went off to the university of georgia.
it wasn't until she fell in love for the first time in her life that she [MASK] everything away.
sadly, she couldn't say that her first love was davis, mason's [MASK].
instead, it was another football [MASK], this time a running back at uga, who captured and later broke her heart a year later.
carsyn ran with the [MASK] crowd, and when she was with him, she partied and drank too much.
he was controlling and [MASK], and he wanted all of her time.
when she was with him, she had little time for [MASK].
with her grades already in the toilet, she was [MASK] for the emotional breakdown she experienced when carsyn broke up with her.
devastated, she [MASK] going to class and ended up flunking the semester.
by the time she got [MASK] on track with her grades, she had abandoned any hope of medical school.
instead, she decided that she would become a [MASK], which would fulfill her need to care for sick people.
of course, her relationship with davis ended up derailing shortly [MASK] graduation when she got pregnant unexpectedly.
she had to take several semesters off after mason was [MASK].
she was a few years off from when she had [MASK] planned on graduating, but she was excited after everything had that had happened, she was finally finishing.
her mother's voice brought megan out of her [MASK].
here we are, she said [MASK].
leaning forward in her [MASK], megan eyed the clock on the dashboard.
she wasn't surprised to see they had arrived half an hour before the baptism [MASK].
one thing her mother prided herself on was being on time and lending a [MASK].
as they started into the church, her mother [MASK] for mason.
we'll take him so you can go see if emma [MASK] any help.
megan bent [MASK] to kiss mason's cheek.
see you in a [MASK] while, sweetie.
he grinned and then happily dodged her mother's arms for her father's instead, which made megan [MASK].
he was such a man's man [MASK].
